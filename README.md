- Be as creative as you can.

Tech requirements:
- The app must be deployed.

- The canvas should be 800px by 450px.

Must not include:

```

## Approach

I have started first to researching how to create a canvas with React.

After I was searching for documentation that will let me to animate any objects, I have found two different solutions, one is using React Hooks, and the other one is using React Class component by updating the states. I have decided to use the Class Component, so I could wrap the animations in Animations Component.

Once I have understood how to draw different objects, I have exctracted each object that I have draw in different functions, which allowed me to manage each object separetely.

At the last I have animated the object such as UFO, Shooting Star and Tank.
